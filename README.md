Announcing the new Notepad++ on Windows - Notepad++ 7.4 released

I have made Edge as my default browser recently (nice browser BTW, a lack of "search in Google" command though), one of awesome features in Edge is peeking page while mouse hovering on a inactive tab. By hovering mouse on any inactive tab, you can preview document displaying under the tab, or / and on document map. This feature can be disabled easily by unchecking "Peek on tab" of Document Peeker, in MISC. section of Preferences dialog.

The regression of replace in files in v7.4.1 has been fixed.There are also some fixed bugs and 1 enhancement (Resizable Find & Replace Dialog) including in this release.
