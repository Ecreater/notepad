## Announcing the new Notepad++ on Windows - Notepad++ 7.4 released

I have made Edge as my default browser recently (nice browser BTW, a lack of "search in Google" command though), one of awesome features in Edge is peeking page while mouse hovering on a inactive tab. By hovering mouse on any inactive tab, you can preview document displaying under the tab, or / and on document map. This feature can be disabled easily by unchecking "Peek on tab" of Document Peeker, in MISC. section of Preferences dialog.

With v7.4.1, we has created a more user-friendly version of notepad++ for programmers. Now v7.4.2 provides many powerful programming plug-ins to help improve your coud while you are developing softwares.

There are not many plugins added in this time around, but it's something we are thinking about for a future version, and the new version will be launched just in a few days if there's no critical issue found. 

I hope you enjoy Notepad++ as much as I enjoy coding it.
